This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's FlatList component when handling extensive datasets. The `FlatListBug.js` file showcases the problem, resulting in sluggish UI rendering and potential freezes.  The solution, provided in `FlatListBugSolution.js`, uses techniques like item optimization, windowSize adjustment in FlatList, and potentially memoization to improve performance significantly.  This example is designed to help developers understand and address similar challenges in their React Native applications.  Feel free to use and modify this code for your projects.
