The solution involves several key optimizations:

1. **Item Optimization:** Reduce complexity within the item rendering function.  Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components or using `React.memo`.  Ensure that computations are efficient and avoid heavy operations within the render cycle.

2. **FlatList Optimization:** Adjust the `windowSize` prop in FlatList to control the number of rendered items.  A smaller `windowSize` improves initial render times, but may require careful consideration to avoid issues with data that needs to be visible near the edges. 

3. **Data Handling:** If the data is extremely large consider using pagination or infinite scrolling. Pre-process data to improve efficiency.  Instead of updating the entire FlatList state on small data changes, consider using techniques like `useMemo` and only updating relevant parts of the data. 

4. **Virtualization:** In case of extremely large data or complex list items, consider using a more advanced React Native library specifically built for efficient list virtualization. 

Example of optimized renderItem:
```javascript
const MemoizedItem = React.memo(({ item }) => {
  // Optimized item rendering logic here
  return <Text>{item.title}</Text>;
});
```

Example of using windowSize:
```javascript
<FlatList 
  data={data} 
  renderItem={({ item }) => <MemoizedItem item={item} />} 
  windowSize={10} // Adjust this value based on your data size and performance requirements
/>
```
