This React Native bug occurs when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  The issue stems from inefficient rendering and data updates, leading to performance degradation and dropped frames.  The component might freeze or become unresponsive, especially on lower-end devices.  Debugging this often involves profiling the app to identify performance bottlenecks and optimizing rendering processes.
